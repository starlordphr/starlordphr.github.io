      <p>The paradigm shift of enabling extensive intercommunication between the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) devices allows vulnerabilities typical to the IT world to propagate to the OT side. Therefore, the security layer offered in the past by air gapping is removed, making security patching for OT devices a hard requirement. Conventional patching involves a device reboot to load the patched code in the main memory, which does not apply to OT devices controlling critical processes due to downtime, necessitating in-memory vulnerability patching. Furthermore, these control binaries are often compiled by in-house proprietary compilers, further hindering the patching process and placing reliance on OT vendors for rapid vulnerability discovery and patch development. The current state-of-the-art hotpatching approaches only focus on firmware and/or RTOS. Therefore, in this work, we develop ICSPatch, a framework to automate control logic vulnerability localization using Data Dependence Graphs (DDGs). With the help of DDGs, ICSPatch pinpoints the vulnerability in the control application. As an independent second step, ICSPatch can non-intrusively hotpatch vulnerabilities in the control application directly in the main memory of Programmable Logic Controllers while maintaining reliable continuous operation. To evaluate our framework, we test ICSPatch on a synthetic dataset of 24 vulnerable control application binaries from diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Results show that ICSPatch could successfully localize all vulnerabilities and generate patches accordingly. Furthermore, the patch added negligible latency increase in the execution cycle while maintaining correctness and protection against the vulnerability.</p>

      <p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have played a catalytic role in enabling the 4th Industrial Revolution. ICS devices like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), automate, monitor, and control critical processes in industrial, energy, and commercial environments. The convergence of traditional Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) has opened a new and unique threat landscape. This has inspired defense research that focuses heavily on Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection methods that run on external IT hardware, which means an increase in costs and the further expansion of the threat landscape. To remove this requirement, we introduce the ICS machine learning inference framework (ICSML) which enables the execution of ML model inference natively on the PLC. ICSML is implemented in IEC 61131-3 code and provides several optimizations to bypass the limitations imposed by the domain-specific languages. Therefore, it works \emph{on every PLC without the need for vendor support}. ICSML provides a complete set of components for the creation of full ML models similarly to established ML frameworks. We run a series of benchmarks studying memory and performance and compare our solution to the TFLite inference framework. At the same time, we develop domain-specific model optimizations to improve the efficiency of ICSML. To demonstrate the abilities of ICSML, we evaluate a case study of a real defense for process-aware attacks targeting a desalination plant.</p>

      <p>With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, networked industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have been introduced for critical infrastructure control. A number of recent discoveries of exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party libraries in such devices has raised concerns about their supply chain security. Supply chain security verification of software used in this context is challenging due to the proprietary nature of the platforms, and the difficulty of their runtime introspection. In particular, network-based fuzzing is often the only way to test the devices, but without guidance through execution tracing this fuzzing is inefficient. In this work, present a novel approach for dynamic analysis of such platforms, leveraging two main contributions: i) a 'Ghost' application injected into the fuzzing target to allow on-system tracing and coverage computation, and ii) stateful fuzzing based on automated command discovery and status code extraction. We present FieldFuzz, a framework that realizes this approach for the widespread Codesys runtime for PLCs used by 80 industrial device vendors ranging from over 400 devices. Our fuzzing campaigns uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, leading to three reported CVE IDs. To study the cross-platform applicability of FieldFuzz, we reproduce the findings on a diverse set of Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p>

      <p>Over the years, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manufacturers have started embracing extensive system library support provided by control logic development software, easing the development process. Furthermore, these runtimes controlling the execution of the control application do not provide the same level of isolation as an Operating System, enabling an adversary to exploit vulnerabilities in the imported libraries to launch an attack. The identification and patching of vulnerabilities in the control logic of an ICS are not as straightforward as on a personal computer because devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have specialized requirements. For instance, these devices have operated in the field continuously for years without disruptive upgrades. Moreover, often control application logic executes as a thread of the runtime process, making it challenging to locate the vulnerability directly in the main memory. In this work, we will present a non-intrusive approach for vulnerability localization and selective patching of PLC control binaries while the device is online and controlling parts of critical infrastructure. More specifically, we start by understanding how a runtime loads control logic, providing insight into its memory mapping and address resolution. We then utilize this knowledge for extracting and rehosting the firmware (runtime) from a testing PLC, running an identical setup to the deployed PLC for performing concolic execution of the control application using angr. This enables our tool to automatically identify vulnerabilities such as out-of-bound memory write and read, OS command injection, and improper input validation, some of the topmost dangerous software weaknesses for 2021. Finally, it performs vulnerability localization by traversing over the data dependence graph generated for the control binary and non-intrusively hot-patches these vulnerabilities. This technique is non-intrusive, i.e., it does not impact the PLC's operation and does not require taking it offline, making it suitable for PLC devices that cannot be decommissioned. We will demonstrate the non-intrusiveness of our technique live on PLCs executing parts of various critical infrastructure sectors in a lab environment.</p>

      <p>Digitization has been rapidly integrated with manufacturing industries and critical infrastructure to increase efficiency, productivity, and reduce wastefulness, a transition being labeled as Industry 4.0. However, this expansion, coupled with the poor cybersecurity posture of these Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, has made them prolific targets for exploitation. Moreover, modern Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) used in the Operational Technology (OT) sector are adopting open-source operating systems such as Linux instead of proprietary software, making such devices susceptible to Linux-based malware. Traditional malware detection approaches cannot be applied directly or extended to such environments due to the unique restrictions of these PLC devices, such as limited computational power and real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose ORRIS, a novel lightweight and out-of-the-device framework that detects malware at both kernel and user-level by processing the information collected using the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface. We evaluate ORRIS against in-the-wild Linux malware achieving maximum detection accuracy of 99.7% with very few false-positive occurrences, a result comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial products. Moreover, we also develop and demonstrate a real-time implementation of ORRIS for commercial PLCs.</p>

      <p>The convergence of the Operational Technology (OT) sector with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased cyberattacks on prominent OT devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). These devices have limited computational capabilities, no antivirus support, strict real-time requirements, and often older, unpatched operating systems. The use of traditional malware detection approaches can impact the real-time performance of such devices. Due to these constraints, we propose Amaya, an external malware detection mechanism based on a combination of signature detection and machine learning. This technique employs remote analysis of malware binaries collected from the main memory of the PLC by a non-intrusive method using the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) port. We evaluate Amaya against in-the-wild malware for ARM and x86 architecture, achieving an accuracy of 98% and 94.7%, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze concept drift, spatial experimental bias, and the effects of downsampling the feature vector to understand the behavior of the model in a real-world setting.</p>

      <p>JTAG is an IEEE standard for testing and debugging electronic circuits. In general, this standard allows serial test instructions and test data to be passed through the input ports. After execution of test instructions, the corresponding serial output can be shifted out. Due to this powerful low level hardware access, JTAG has been explored in literature for performing cyber attacks on devices. On the other hand, its potential has also been realized to defend against attacks at the lowest level. In this paper, we explore JTAG as a tool on both ends of the spectrum.</p>

      <p>In 2017, desalination industry was contracted to produce 99.8 million m<sup>3</sup>/d of fresh water globally. In regions with a natural shortage of fresh water, desalination contributes up to 70% of drinking water. While state-of-the-art research has focused on securing the power grid, water treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure, not much attention has been given towards desalination plants. In this work, we perform interdisciplinary cyber threat analysis on a desalination plant model, presenting cyberattacks and analyzing their effect on the plant performance and equipment both from economics and mechanical engineering perspective. Our analysis shows that cyber actors can perform extensive financial damage by affecting the performance of the plant. We also perform control volume analysis and finite element analysis studies to investigate the possibility of Stuxnet-like attacks with the potential to cause mechanical damage and equipment failure.</p>
