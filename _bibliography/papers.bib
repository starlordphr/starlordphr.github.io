  abstract={The convergence of the Operational Technology (OT) sector with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased cyberattacks on prominent OT devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). These devices have limited computational capabilities, no antivirus support, strict real-time requirements, and often older, unpatched operating systems. The use of traditional malware detection approaches can impact the real-time performance of such devices. Due to these constraints, we propose Amaya, an external malware detection mechanism based on a combination of signature detection and machine learning. This technique employs remote analysis of malware binaries collected from the main memory of the PLC by a non-intrusive method using the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) port. We evaluate Amaya against in-the-wild malware for ARM and x86 architecture, achieving an accuracy of 98% and 94.7%, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze concept drift, spatial experimental bias, and the effects of downsampling the feature vector to understand the behavior of the model in a real-world setting.},

abstract={JTAG is an IEEE standard for testing and debugging electronic circuits. In general, this standard allows serial test instructions and test data to be passed through the input ports. After execution of test instructions, the corresponding serial output can be shifted out. Due to this powerful low level hardware access, JTAG has been explored in literature for performing cyber attacks on devices. On the other hand, its potential has also been realized to defend against attacks at the lowest level. In this paper, we explore JTAG as a tool on both ends of the spectrum.},

abstract = {In 2017, desalination industry was contracted to produce 99.8 million m<sup>3</sup>/d of fresh water globally. In regions with a natural shortage of fresh water, desalination contributes up to 70% of drinking water. While state-of-the-art research has focused on securing the power grid, water treatment plants, and other critical infrastructure, not much attention has been given towards desalination plants. In this work, we perform interdisciplinary cyber threat analysis on a desalination plant model, presenting cyberattacks and analyzing their effect on the plant performance and equipment both from economics and mechanical engineering perspective. Our analysis shows that cyber actors can perform extensive financial damage by affecting the performance of the plant. We also perform control volume analysis and finite element analysis studies to investigate the possibility of Stuxnet-like attacks with the potential to cause mechanical damage and equipment failure.},
