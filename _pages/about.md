I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science department at New York University, making this world a (cyber) secure place. As a part of the [MoMA Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/momalab/), headed by [Prof. Michail Maniatakos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aqQ_eLYAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1), my research focuses on embedded systems security and industrial control systems security. I extend the traditional malware detection and vulnerability patching approaches to less powerful ICS devices that bring unique challenges.

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I was a part of the Bruin family at the University of California Los Angeles, where I completed my Master's Degree in Computer Science under the guidance of [Prof. Rafail Ostrovsky](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/).
