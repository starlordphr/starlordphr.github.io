#### At Facebook
* **Improving Disassembly Database Support in ThreatData**<br/>
*Facebook, Menlo Park, CA*
    * Created EntDisassemblerDatabase, a schema to represent disassembly databases and associated it with existing ThreatData graph.
    * Modified ThreatData UI to upload disassembly databases using FB upload service and preview related intel source reports.
    * Designed and implemented TDSync, an IDA plugin to enable annotation sync between local instances and Disassembly UI.
    * Reduced redundant data in a GraphQL mutation by utilizing diffs between consecutive annotation states.

#### At NYU

* **Automated Vulnerability Localization and Non-Intrusive Hotpatching in ICS**<br/>
*MoMA Lab, NYU*
    * Developed ICSPatch to localize vulnerabilities in control logic using Data Dependence Graph, non-intrusively hotpatch it using an LKM patcher and tested on a synthetic dataset with 24 vulnerable control applications.
    * Successfully localized and hotpatched OOB write/read, OS command injection, and improper input validation, incurring latency of 222ms and 332ms for patch generation and deployment, respectively.<br/>

* **Platform Agnostic Remote Static Analysis Malware Detection for ICS**<br/>
*MoMA Lab, NYU*
    * Implemented external non-intrusive static analysis malware detection leveraging out-of-the-device virtual to physical address translation with JTAG.
    * Performed static analysis of process text section for extracting entropy values for a 32-byte sliding window, string, and syscall histograms, to be utilized as platform-agnostic features.
    * Achieved 98%, 95% malware detection accuracy for ARM and x86_64 architecture, respectively, with an SVM model.<br/>

* **Process-Aware Cyberattacks for Thermal Desalination Plants**<br/>
*Center for Cyber Security, NYUAD*
    * Performed process-aware security assessment of desalination plants to identify attack entry points, categorize the attacks, estimate the corresponding financial loss, and mechanical damage.
    * Computed the resultant thermal shocks and pressure surges during water hammer in the piping system on sudden valve closure in MATLAB.
    * Quantified the detrimental effects of water hammering during such attacks in terms of Maximum induced von Mises stresses (340 MPa) and maximum displacement (19.94mm) with ANSYS.<br/>
